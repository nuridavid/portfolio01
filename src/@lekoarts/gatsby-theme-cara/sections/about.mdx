# About me

I am a front-end developer who fell in love with programming and the analytical thinking associated with it. I grew up thinking very logically and challenged myself to problem-solve with every opportunity I had. I have always been fascinated by technology and have continuously learned new ways to use it.

When I enrolled in a coding class I was finally challenged by technology. This ignited my passion for programming- the satisfaction I got from fixing and refactoring a piece of code was the best feeling I’ve ever experienced!

I’ve always had a yearning to keep learning and I can’t think of a more apropos and fulfilling field to do that than web development! I can’t wait to continue my journey of continuous and consistent learning while also doing what I love.

When I am not building sites, you can find me watching sports games, jogging, and spending time with my loved ones.
